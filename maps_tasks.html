		<h1>Maps</h1>
		<h2>
			Among Us contains multiple different maps players can play on. Below are images of these
			locations, as well as some defining characteristics:
		</h2>
		
		<h3>The SKELD:</h3>
			<p>
				The SKELD is the "first" map in the game. It's usually known as the default map, as it's
				the one players tend to play the most. This is proven by the general archetecture of the
				starting screen, where players seem to be in the "dropship" part of the map.
				The design is pretty straightforward, featuring all
				of the game's most famous locations (Electrical, Medbay, Navigation). Lore wise, the map is thought of 
				as a spaceship, transporting players between MIRA HQ and POLUS.
				<br>
				Some tasks are exclusive to The SKELD. These include "Align Enginge Output" and "Empty Chutes".
			</p>
		<hr>	
		
		<h3>MIRA HQ:</h3>
			<p>
				MIRA HQ is the smallest Among Us map, usually referred to as "the worst" by hardcore players. It
				features a very futuristic design, where the hallways look extremely clean and polished. 
				MIRA also proves other forms of life exist in the game, as there is a large tree encased in glass.
				This tree is one of the defining features of the map. Others include the sensors (see more in <a href = "#otherinteractions">Sabotages and Other Interactions</a>)
			</p>
		<hr>	
		
		<h3>POLUS:</h3>
			<p>
				POLUS is thought of as the final landing destination. It's built like a research station, where players leave the dropship of the SKELD to
				do their tasks on land. It seems to be an alien planet that they've landed on, where the ground is purple and the sky is pitch black.
				The specimen lab in POLUS requires players to inspect things like fossils, as well as sorting different objects. There's also a telescope in Medbay
				which is used to inspect and look for other celestial bodies in space.
			</p>
		<hr>	
		
		<h3>AIRSHIP:</h3>
			<p>
				AIRSHIP is the newest map, featuring a red ship flying through the sky. It's currently unclear who owns the ship, why crewmates have access to it, and 
				where it's going. It's massive, giving players the option to spawn on either floor, as well as the specific room. There's nothing much to note about
				Airship, other than a couple new tasks. The developers, did, however, include a very cool easter egg. The map was based off of Innersloth's other game,
				the fourth episode of the <b>Henry Stickman Collection</b>. The game was titled <a href = "https://henrystickmin.fandom.com/wiki/Infiltrating_the_Airship">"Infiltrating the Airship"</a>, creating this connection.
				It even features the same red ship!

		<h1>Tasks</h1>
		<h2>There are many different tasks in Among Us, making players do many different things.</h2>
		<br>
		<h2>Common Tasks:</h2>
			<p>
				Common tasks are tasks that every single crewmate has. These tasks are like Admin card swipe, POLUS keys, etc. Since Impostors aren't able to 
				do tasks, it's always worth keeping an eye out for anyone faking a common task that you don't have.
			</p>
			<br>
			<p>
				<b>Here is a list of the most common tasks and their locations:</b>
				<table border = "1px">
					<tr>

		<h1 id = "otherinteractions">Sabotages and Other Interactions</h1>
		<h2>Sabotages:</h2>
			<ul>
				<li><span class = "sabotage">Lights</span> - Crewmates lose vision temporarily (until they fix the lights), Impostors are immune</li>
				<li><span class = "sabotage">Oxygen/O2</span> - Impostors cut the oxygen for all Crewmates. Impostors win if the Crewmates don't fix the sabotage in 30-45 seconds</li>
				<li><span class = "sabotage">Reactor</span> - Impostors shut down the reactor, two Crewmates need to be fixing it at the same time. Impostors win if crewmates don't fix the sabotage in 60 seconds</li>
				<li><span class = "sabotage">Communications</span> - Crewmates are unable to do tasks until the sabotage is fixed, buying Impostors some time</li>

			</ul>
			<p>
				Impostors are also able to shut doors. These doors remain locked for a brief period, only being openable on POLUS. If a sabotage is currently going off,
				Crewmates are unable to press the emergency button. The only way to call a meeting would be through reporting a dead body.
			</p>
		<br>
		<h2>Other Interactions:</h2>
			<ul>
				<li><span class = "interaction">Admin Table</span> - A panel in Admin which lets a player (any role) see the location of all other players. These icons, however, remain anonymous.</li>
				<li><span class = "interaction">Vitals</span> - A menu which lets players see the living/death status of other players. If a Crewmate dies, their character will show up as red on this menu.</li>
				<li><span class = "interaction">Security Cameras</span> - Gives players access to Security Cameras located all across the map. Players can open up the cams and see anyone who's standing under them.</li>
